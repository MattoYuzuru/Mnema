# Learning API runtime foundation

`services:learning` is the standalone greenfield Learning API runtime. It has no
Gradle project dependency on the legacy `auth`, `user`, `core`, `media`, `import`
or `ai` applications. Product domains are intentionally absent until their owning
epics add them.

## Runtime contract

- Canonical application context: `/api`; there is no `/v2` or legacy service alias.
- Health: `/api/actuator/health/liveness` and
  `/api/actuator/health/readiness`. Readiness includes PostgreSQL; liveness does
  not depend on external systems.
- Build identity: `/api/actuator/info` exposes reproducible Gradle build metadata
  plus `release.id` from `MNEMA_BUILD_ID` (`dev` only as a local default).
- Database: fresh Flyway history at `classpath:db/learning/migration`, owned schema
  `app_learning`, `baseline-on-migrate=false`. It never scans a legacy migration
  directory.

## Shared platform contracts

- Entity identifiers are non-nil RFC 9562/IETF UUIDs stored as PostgreSQL `uuid`.
  New command identifiers are UUIDv4 or UUIDv7; the portable Java generator emits
  UUIDv4 without an additional dependency.
- Command identity is global by `command_id`. A retry must have the same actor,
  scope, type and canonical payload. An exact retry receives the stored JSON
  result; any mismatch returns `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT` when exposed over HTTP.
  The action and receipt share one JDBC transaction, so failure leaves neither
  side effects nor an in-progress receipt.
- Payload canonicalization is a durable protocol: UTF-8 JSON with lexicographically
  sorted object fields, preserved array order, normalized finite numbers and a
  fixed escaping policy independent of application-wide Jackson configuration.
- Mutable rows use a non-negative `row_version`. Repository SQL performs an update
  guarded by the expected version, and `CompareAndSetExecutor` accepts exactly one
  changed row or raises `VERSION_CONFLICT`.
- API failures use `application/problem+json` (RFC 9457). Stable machine codes are
  `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`, `VERSION_CONFLICT`, `PRECONDITION_REQUIRED`, `INVALID_REQUEST`,
  `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`, `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED` and `INTERNAL_ERROR`. Public details
  never contain exception messages, SQL or stored command data.

PostgreSQL integration tests are fail-closed: Docker absence or container startup
failure fails the build rather than skipping the suite.
